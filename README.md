 # Gemini Repo Inspection
## What is this application?

This application, powered by Google's Gemini large language model, allows you to analyze and gain insights from GitHub repositories. It clones the repository, indexes the files, and then utilizes Gemini's capabilities to answer your questions about the codebase.

## How to use the application:

1. Input Repository URL: Paste the URL of the GitHub repository you want to analyze into the text input field.
2. Clone and Index: Click the "Clone and Index repo" button. This will clone the repository to a local directory and create an index of all files.
3. Select Prompt: Choose a question you want to ask about the codebase from the provided options. These include:
- Summary: Get a high-level overview of the codebase and key learning points.
- Getting Started Guide: Generate instructions for onboarding new developers.
- Issue Identification: Find the most severe issues within the codebase.
- Bug Fix: Locate the most critical bug and receive a potential code fix.
- Troubleshooting Guide: Obtain assistance with resolving common problems.
4. Generate: Click the "Generate" button to send your chosen prompt to the Gemini model.
5. Review Response: The application will display Gemini's response, providing insights and answers based on the codebase and your selected question.


## Additional Information:

- The application utilizes the magika library for file type identification and the vertexai library for interacting with the Gemini model.
- You can reset the demo state and start over by clicking the "Reset Demo State" button.
- Please note that the cost of using the Gemini model is based on the number of tokens processed. The application will display the estimated cost before sending the prompt.
